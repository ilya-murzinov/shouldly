# 2.0.1
 - Fix possible deadlock in `Should.[Not]Throw(Func<Task>)` [#101](https://github.com/shouldly/shouldly/issues/101) +Fix

# 2.0.0

 - **breaking**: Removed ShouldBeCloseTo [#94](https://github.com/shouldly/shouldly/pull/94) [#46](https://github.com/shouldly/shouldly/issues/46)
 - **breaking**: ShouldBeGreaterThan and ShouldBeLessThan are now constrained to `IComparable<T>`
 - **breaking**: Method Grouping on Should.Throw no longer works due to async overloads
 - **breaking**: IEnumerable.ShouldBe(IEnumerable) now uses .Equals to compare
     - specify T to get Item Comparison (`new[]{"foo"}.ShouldBe<string>(new[]{"foo"})` for item comparison, or specify `ignoreOrder` to select IEnumerable overload
     - See Breaking Changes.txt for more information
 - **breaking**: `ShouldBeTypeOf<T>` renamed to `ShouldBeAssignableTo<T>` [#98](https://github.com/shouldly/shouldly/issues/98)
 - `ShouldBeOfType<T>` added for exact match of type, `ShouldBeAssignableTo<T>` allows derived classes [#98](https://github.com/shouldly/shouldly/issues/98)

 **note**: When shouldly is running under .net 4.0 (this affects old versions too) a shouldly assertion inside a compiled lambda will give an incorrect error message (if you do this, let us know why). See [#80](https://github.com/shouldly/shouldly/issues/80)
